<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I am a huge music lover so I knew immediately that my final interactive visualization would be music related. After finding a dataset, I explored the data in Excel as that is the application I am most comfortable with. I transformed the values into a table so I could explore the data using pivot tables and native Excel charts. I used this process to form the questions I wanted to explore with my visual.
  I compiled a list of four questions that I thought I could build visuals around.

 <p>In the image above, you can see the data I used to create my pivot tables. The dataset contains information about users listening habits. The data includes information about the user’s country, age, streaming platform, and the artist they listened to. The dataset also includes the amount of time each user spent listening to music on each platform. The dataset contains 5,001 rows and 12 columns. The columns include attributes like::
  <ul>
    <li>Country</li>
    <li>Age</li>
    <li>Platform</li>
    <li>Artist</li>
    <li>Genre</li>
    <li>Listening Time</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>In the image above, you can see a bar chart I created in Excel to explore the data. I used this chart as a rough draft of the visual I planned to create.</p>

  <p>After exploring the data, I created a list of questions I wanted to answer with my visualization.
<p>These questions included:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Which countries had the highest listening time?</li>
    <li>Who is the top artist for each country?</li>
    <li>Who is the top artist among each age group?</li>
    <li>What is the most popular genre among each age group?</li>
  </ul>

  Initially my goal for this project was to create a dashboard with multiple charts to interact with. As I began coding, I realized that I don’t have the skillset to create some of the visuals.
 </p>
 <p>I decided to focus on the question, "Who is the top artist among each age group? I also decided I would add the filter element of By Platform to make the visualization interactive.</p>

 <h2>Research & Resources</h2>
 <p>Before beginning the design process, I reviewed projects available online and their source code. Some of the resources I use to complete my project are the D3 website, GitHub and various Youtube tutorials. </p>

 <h2>Coding Process</h2>
 <p>For the coding process, I began writing snippets in Notepad. I quickly realized this wouldn't be the right tool for this project. I moved to the Atom text editor next. I found this platform to be easier to use but still
  not the best for my needs. I finally moved to Visual Studio Code. I found this platform to be the best for my needs. I was able to easily write and edit code snippets. I also used the built in terminal to run my code. I found this to be the most efficient way to work on my project.</p>
 <p>I used the D3.js library to create my visualization...the bar chart and all its components, the filter, the dropdown menu for the filter.</p>
 </p>

 <p>I iterated through my code multiple times to debug and revise as I have never worked with Javascript or D3 in the past. Initially, I was going to build a dashboard with multiple visualizations but ultimately decided a single visual was best for time constraints and my limited skillset.</p>

 <h2>Design</h2>
 <p>I am a fan of minimalist design so I tried to keep my design elements simple. I chose a white background, black text color and red for the bars for the high contrast. I placed a border around the dropdown menu for platform selection to 
  emphasize the filter element. I also added a title and labels to the axes to make the visual more informative. I used a sans-serif font for the text to keep the design clean and modern.</p>
<p>I used a bar chart to display the data. I chose a bar chart because it is easy to read and understand. I also used a dropdown menu to allow users to filter the data by platform. This allows users to see the data in different ways and makes the visual more interactive.</p>
